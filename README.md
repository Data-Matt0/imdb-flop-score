# IMDb Flop Score

This project enriches a dataset of IMDb's lowest-rated 200 movies by fetching financial and popularity data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.  
The goal is to define a custom **Flop Score** that combines box office loss and poor audience reception to highlight the biggest cinematic failures.
